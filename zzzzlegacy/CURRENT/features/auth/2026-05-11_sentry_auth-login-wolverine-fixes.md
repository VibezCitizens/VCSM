## Finding 1 — Cross-Feature Boundary Violation

**Original ARCHITECT finding:** `register.dal.js` imported `getWandersSupabase` directly — a cross-feature client import inside a DAL.

**SENTRY verification:**

`register.dal.js` (line 1): imports only `supabase` from `@/services/supabase/supabaseClient`.

No wanders import anywhere in the file. Confirmed via full file read.

`register.controller.js` (line 1): imports `getWandersSupabase` from `@/features/wanders/adapters/services/wandersSupabaseClient.adapter`.

This is a cross-feature import through the declared adapter boundary path (`.../adapters/services/`). This path pattern is the approved cross-feature access mechanism per VCSM Architecture Contract §5.4. Controller consuming an adapter is correct layer placement.

**Resolution status:** ✅ RESOLVED — Boundary violation eliminated. Wanders client access moved to controller via approved adapter import.

---

## Finding 2 — Missing Auth Guard on AuthPublicRoute

**Original ARCHITECT finding:** `AuthPublicRoute.jsx` did not redirect authenticated users, allowing them to reach login/register screens while already authenticated.

**SENTRY verification:**

```jsx
export default function AuthPublicRoute({ children }) {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()

  useEffect(() => { hideLaunchSplash() }, [])

  if (loading) return null
  if (user) return <Navigate to="/feed" replace />
  return children
}
```

Auth state is sourced from `useAuth()` → `AuthProvider` context (not direct Supabase call — correct hook layer usage).

Loading guard returns null — prevents flash of auth content during session hydration.

User guard redirects to `/feed` with `replace` — prevents back-button return to auth route.

**Route loop risk:** `/feed` is a protected route. If `AuthPublicRoute` wraps `/feed`, a loop would occur. This is a routing config risk, not an `AuthPublicRoute` implementation risk. The component itself is correct. No loop was introduced by this change. Routing config must ensure `/feed` is not wrapped in `AuthPublicRoute`.

**Resolution status:** ✅ RESOLVED — Guard implemented. No loops introduced by this file.

---

## Finding 3 — Duplicate getSession Wrappers

**Original ARCHITECT finding:** 4 separate DAL methods all calling `supabase.auth.getSession()`.

**SENTRY verification:**

| Method (former) | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `dalGetCurrentSession` | `authCallback.dal.js` | ✅ REMOVED |
| `dalGetRecoverySession` | `resetPassword.dal.js` | ✅ REMOVED |
| `readCurrentSessionUserDAL` | `onboarding.dal.js` | ✅ REMOVED |
| `dalGetAuthSession` (canonical) | `authSession.read.dal.js` | ✅ PRESERVED |

Canonical DAL method:
```js
export async function dalGetAuthSession() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
  if (error) throw error
  return data?.session ?? null
}
```

Returns `session | null`. Throws on error. All 3 consuming controllers import from this single DAL.

`dalHydrateAuthSession()` also remains in `authSession.read.dal.js` — returns the raw Supabase promise for backward compat with `authSession.controller.js`. This is a separate concern and does not create a duplicate.

`readCurrentAuthUserDAL()` remains in `onboarding.dal.js` — this calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` (not `getSession()`). Different Supabase method, different return shape. Not a duplicate. Correctly preserved.

**Circular dependency check:** `authSession.read.dal.js` imports only `supabase` from services. No feature-layer circular path. Confirmed clean.

**Resolution status:** ✅ RESOLVED — 3 duplicates eliminated. Single canonical DAL consolidated. No circular dependencies.

---

## Finding 4 — Param Naming Trap

**Original ARCHITECT finding:** `ensureProfileDiscoverable(profileId)` parameter name suggested it received a `profileId` (VCSM contract violation), but it actually received a `userId` (Supabase auth UUID).

**SENTRY verification:**

```js
export async function ensureProfileDiscoverable(userId) {
  const row = await dalGetProfileDiscoverable(userId)
  const profile = ProfileModel(row)
  if (!profile) return
  if (!profile.isDiscoverable) {
    await dalUpdateProfileDiscoverable({
      profileId: userId,   // DAL interface parameter name — internal to DAL
      discoverable: true,
      updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
  }
}
```

Function signature: `userId` — correct. Supabase auth UUID.

Internal DAL call passes `profileId: userId` as the DAL parameter name. This is the DAL's internal interface naming (mapping to DB column `id`). This is acceptable — the DAL parameter name is an internal interface label, not a public surface. The variable `userId` passed in is correctly named.

**Identity surface check:** The public function signature now uses `userId`, not `profileId`. Callers that previously passed `userId` under the name `profileId` will now pass it correctly. No external surface exposes `profileId` as authority.

**Resolution status:** ✅ RESOLVED — Public function param renamed. Internal DAL interface name preserved (no behavior change, correct semantics).

---

## Finding 5 — UI Rule Violation (Arrow Icon)

**Original ARCHITECT finding:** `WelcomeScreen.jsx` used `<ArrowRight>` icon — violates platform vocabulary rule (no arrow symbols in UI).

**SENTRY verification:**

`WelcomeScreen.jsx` was provided via system context (read at session start). Current state shows no `ArrowRight` import and no arrow icon in JSX. Confirmed removed.

UI is clean: option cards render icon + title + description only. No arrows anywhere.

**Resolution status:** ✅ RESOLVED — Arrow removed. No regression in card layout.

---

## Boundary Findings

### ✅ APPROVED — register.controller.js → wanders adapter import

`register.controller.js` imports `getWandersSupabase` from:
```
@/features/wanders/adapters/services/wandersSupabaseClient.adapter
```

This is a controller importing from another feature's **adapter layer** — the approved cross-feature boundary per architecture contract. Adapters exist precisely to expose controlled surfaces to other features. Adapter path contains `.adapter` suffix confirming the boundary is explicit.

**Classification:** Approved cross-feature adapter boundary. Not a violation.

---

### ✅ CLEAN — dalGetAuthSession no circular dependencies

Import chain for `dalGetAuthSession`:
```
authCallback.controller    → authSession.read.dal → @/services/supabase/supabaseClient
setNewPassword.controller  → authSession.read.dal → @/services/supabase/supabaseClient
onboarding.controller      → authSession.read.dal → @/services/supabase/supabaseClient
```

`authSession.read.dal.js` imports only from `@/services/supabase/supabaseClient`. No feature-layer imports. No circular path possible.

---

### ✅ CLEAN — onboarding.controller.js identity surface

`onboarding.controller.js` uses `session?.user?.id` as the canonical user identifier throughout. Passed as `userId` in return values and to `ensureVcsmPlatformBootstrap`.

At line 116-121, `createUserActorForProfile` receives `{ profileId: user.id, userId: user.id }`. Both resolve to the same Supabase auth UUID. `createUserActorForProfile` is a controller-to-controller call (internal boundary). The `profileId` param at this boundary is an internal controller interface name — not a public hook surface. No identity contract violation.

---

## Advisory Notes

### ADVISORY 1 — dalMirrorWandersSessionToPrimary warm-up call

**Location:** `register.dal.js` lines 58–64

```js
export async function dalMirrorWandersSessionToPrimary({ accessToken, refreshToken }) {
  const { error: setSessionError } = await supabase.auth.setSession({ ... })
  if (setSessionError) throw setSessionError

  const { error: warmError } = await supabase.auth.getSession()  // result discarded
  if (warmError) throw warmError
}
```

The second `getSession()` call discards its result. This is a warm-up pattern to force Supabase client to internalize the session after `setSession`. The pattern is valid but the intent is non-obvious. No bug. No security risk.

**Action required:** None. Advisory only.

---

### ADVISORY 2 — onboarding.dal.js uses `profiles` table without schema prefix

**Location:** `onboarding.dal.js` lines 11–85

Several DAL methods query `from('profiles')` without an explicit schema prefix (e.g., `from('vc.profiles')`). This depends on Supabase client default schema config.

If the schema search path is not set to `vc` in the Supabase client configuration, these queries may target the wrong schema or fail silently.

**Action required:** Verify Supabase client config sets `schema: 'vc'` or that `profiles` resolves correctly in the active search path. Assign to DB review if not already confirmed.

---

## Required Corrections

None. All 5 findings resolved. No new violations introduced. No architectural contract breaches.

## FINDING 1 — HIGH

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/app/providers/AuthProvider.jsx line 162
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

AuthProvider exposes the full `session` object in React context:

```jsx
<AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, session, loading, logout }}>
```

The `session` object is the raw Supabase `Session` shape and contains:
- `access_token` — a JWT bearing the authenticated user's claims
- `refresh_token` — used to obtain new access tokens
- `expires_at`, `expires_in`, `token_type`
- `user` (duplicated from the `user` context field)

Any component calling `useAuth()` can destructure and read these token values directly.

**Risk:**

The token surface is broader than necessary. Any component in the React tree — including third-party components, plugin components, or future features — can read `access_token` and `refresh_token` by calling `useAuth()`. If any of these components has an XSS vector or an unintended data exposure path, the tokens are immediately available.

**Severity:** HIGH

**Exploitability:** MEDIUM
Attack Preconditions:
- Authenticated session must exist
- Attacker must reach code that calls `useAuth()` and reads `session.access_token`
- Requires XSS, a malicious imported dependency, or a future careless component

**Blast Radius:** Feed-wide — all authenticated components share this context

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen
**Boundary Violated:** Session tokens exposed beyond the auth layer into the UI component tree

**RLS Dependency:** NONE — this is an app-layer exposure risk

**Why it matters:**

Refresh tokens are long-lived credentials. If extracted, they allow persistent account access without re-authentication. The `session` object belongs in the auth layer, not the component tree.

**Recommended mitigation:**

Remove `session` from the context value. Consumers that need the access token for direct Supabase calls should use the Supabase client directly (which manages the token internally). Consumers that need auth state need only `user` and `loading`. The `session` field in context is almost certainly unused by UI components — it exists as an artifact of the original implementation.

```jsx
// Only expose what UI actually needs
<AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, loading, logout }}>
```

If server-to-server token forwarding is needed, create a controlled `getAccessToken()` function that retrieves the current token on-demand rather than keeping it in shared state.

**Rationale:** Defense in depth — tokens should not reside in the broadest shared state in the app.

**Follow-up command:** DB (verify RLS on Supabase tables does not depend on front-end token forwarding), LOGAN (update AuthProvider docs)

## FINDING 2 — HIGH

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/model/actor.model.js line 6
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

```js
export function ActorModel(row) {
  if (!row) return null
  return {
    id: row.id,
    kind: row.kind,
    profileId: row.profile_id,   // ← explicitly named as profileId
    isVoid: Boolean(row.is_void),
  }
}
```

`ActorModel` returns `profileId` as a named public field. This model is consumed by `createUserActorForProfile`, which returns the model output to `onboarding.controller.js`, which in turn returns it to `useAuthOnboarding`. The actor object — including `profileId` — then reaches hook state and potentially component renders.

**Risk:**

The VCSM identity contract explicitly prohibits exposing `profileId` on public surfaces:

> "Never expose profileId or vportId through useIdentity() or any public hook/controller surface."

`profileId` is the raw Supabase `auth.users.id` UUID. If this value reaches:
- URL construction paths
- Share flows
- API response bodies
- localStorage or state that persists across sessions

...it becomes an identity surface that violates the actor-based model. An actor's `profileId` can be used to query `profiles` directly, bypassing actor-based access control.

**Severity:** HIGH

**Exploitability:** MEDIUM
Attack Preconditions:
- Authenticated session with a completed actor
- Access to the hook or component that reads the actor model output

**Blast Radius:** Single actor — affects the authenticated user's own identity shape, but any feature consuming the actor model gets the profileId

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen
**Boundary Violated:** profileId should not leave the controller layer

**RLS Dependency:** NONE — this is an app-layer model design issue

**Why it matters:**

Even if `profileId` is not currently rendered or stored insecurely, its presence in the model output creates a standing violation of the identity contract that will propagate as the codebase grows. Future developers will read the model and treat `profileId` as a legitimate public field.

**Recommended mitigation:**

Strip `profileId` from ActorModel output. The model should expose only `{ id, kind, isVoid }`. Any internal logic that requires `profileId` (e.g., refreshActorFn calls) should handle it before the model is applied — in the controller, using `actor.profile_id` from the raw row before passing through ActorModel.

```js
export function ActorModel(row) {
  if (!row) return null
  return {
    id: row.id,
    kind: row.kind,
    isVoid: Boolean(row.is_void),
    // profileId deliberately omitted — use actorId for all public surfaces
  }
}
```

**Rationale:** Model outputs are the shape that propagates to hooks and components. profileId must not be in that shape per identity contract.

**Follow-up command:** LOGAN (update actor model docs), review-contract (verify no other models expose profileId)

**CISSP Domain:**
- Primary: Asset Security
- Secondary: Identity and Access Management

## FINDING 3 — MEDIUM

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/wanders/services/wandersSupabaseClient.js line 153
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

```js
const g = globalThis
g.__WANDERS_SB__ = client
```

The Wanders Supabase client — a fully initialized Supabase client with active auth state and token storage — is stored as a named property on `globalThis` (`window` in browser context). This is an HMR-safe singleton pattern.

**Risk:**

In a browser, `window.__WANDERS_SB__` is accessible from any JavaScript execution context on the same origin, including:
- XSS payloads injected into any page
- Malicious browser extensions with `content_scripts` permissions
- Compromised dependencies executing in the page

An attacker who achieves JavaScript execution can call `window.__WANDERS_SB__.auth.getSession()` and retrieve the Wanders session, including `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Exploitability:** LOW
Attack Preconditions:
- XSS vulnerability on the origin, OR a malicious browser extension with content script access
- Wanders flow must have been initiated (client only created when `getWandersSupabase()` is called)

**Blast Radius:** Single actor — Wanders guest session for the current device

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen / Wanders Guest
**Boundary Violated:** Token storage accessible via global namespace

**RLS Dependency:** NONE — token exposure is client-layer

**Why it matters:**

Wanders sessions represent guest identity with potentially anonymous auth state. Token theft could allow impersonation of the Wanders guest session or use of the Wanders Supabase client for unauthorized API calls.

**Recommended mitigation:**

Option A (preferred): Use a module-scoped variable instead of `globalThis`. Since the module system handles HMR, a module-level `let cachedClient` with key tracking achieves the same singleton guarantee without global exposure.

Option B: If `globalThis` is required for cross-module HMR sharing, use an opaque key that cannot be guessed from reading the source (`__WS_${hash}__` derived from the storageKey, not a static string).

**Rationale:** Named global properties are part of the attacker's reconnaissance checklist. Remove predictable auth client globals.

**Follow-up command:** DEADPOOL (if wanders auth issues arise), VENOM (follow-up after fix)

- Primary: Asset Security
- Secondary: Software Development Security

## FINDING 4 — MEDIUM

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/dal/profile.dal.js lines 14-28
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

```js
export async function dalUpdateProfileDiscoverable({ profileId, discoverable, updatedAt }) {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .update({ discoverable, updated_at: updatedAt })
    .eq('id', profileId)

  if (error) throw error
}
```

This DAL writes to the `profiles` table using a caller-provided `profileId` with no app-layer ownership verification. The DAL trusts the caller entirely.

**Current call chain (safe today):**

```
useLogin → ensureProfileDiscoverable(data.user.id) → dalUpdateProfileDiscoverable({ profileId: userId })
```

`data.user.id` comes from the Supabase sign-in response — server-authoritative. The current path is safe.

**Risk:**

The DAL itself has no protection. If any future caller passes an arbitrary `profileId`, it will update that profile's discoverable field without any ownership check. The exported function has no signature hint that `profileId` must match the session user.

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Exploitability:** LOW (currently — call site is safe; future call sites are the risk)
Attack Preconditions:
- A future feature that calls `dalUpdateProfileDiscoverable` with a user-provided `profileId`
- No RLS on `profiles` table for the `discoverable` column, OR RLS using the wrong policy

**Blast Radius:** Single actor — one profile's discoverable status

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen
**Boundary Violated:** DAL write without ownership gate

**RLS Dependency:** ASSUMED — behavior depends on Supabase RLS enforcing ownership on the `profiles` table

**Why it matters:**

Discoverable status controls whether a profile appears in search/explore. Setting `discoverable: true` for another user without their consent is a privacy violation. Setting `discoverable: false` could effectively hide another user's profile from discovery (a soft DoS on their presence).

**Recommended mitigation:**

Add an app-layer ownership assertion in the controller before the DAL call, or document the RLS policy and verify it enforces `auth.uid() = id` on the `profiles` table. The DAL should not be callable with arbitrary IDs — the controller should validate `userId === session.user.id`.

**Rationale:** DAL write surfaces should have ownership verified before the write is issued, not just assumed from the call context.

**Follow-up command:** DB (verify RLS policy on profiles.discoverable write path)

## FINDING 5 — MEDIUM

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/dal/register.dal.js:34
                   apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/dal/actorOwnerCreate.dal.js:3
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

`dalUpsertRegisterProfile` writes to `profiles` with caller-provided `userId`:
```js
export async function dalUpsertRegisterProfile({ client, userId, email, ... }) {
  const c = resolveClient(client)
  const { error } = await c.from('profiles').upsert({ id: userId, email, ... })
  if (error) throw error
}
```

`dalCreateActorOwner` writes to `vc.actor_owners` with caller-provided `actorId` and `userId`:
```js
export async function dalCreateActorOwner(actorId, userId) {
  const { error } = await supabase.schema('vc').from('actor_owners')
    .upsert({ actor_id: actorId, user_id: userId }, { onConflict: 'actor_id,user_id', ignoreDuplicates: true })
  if (error) throw error
}
```

Both DALs accept externally-provided IDs with no internal ownership validation.

**Risk:**

`actor_owners` is the canonical VCSM ownership table. An unchecked write claiming `{ actor_id: targetActorId, user_id: authenticatedUserId }` would give the authenticated user ownership over any actor. The current call chain is safe — `actorId` comes from the RPC response and `userId` from the session — but the DAL surface itself is unguarded.

Similarly, `dalUpsertRegisterProfile` accepting an arbitrary `userId` would allow a caller to upsert a profile row under any user ID.

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Exploitability:** LOW (safe today — call chains use server-authoritative IDs)
Attack Preconditions:
- A future call site that provides an attacker-controlled `actorId` or `userId`
- RLS on `vc.actor_owners` not enforcing ownership constraints

**Blast Radius:** Multi-actor — `actor_owners` write would affect ownership across the platform

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen → VPORT Owner escalation path
**Boundary Violated:** DAL write with no ownership enforcement; ownership escalation possible if called carelessly

**RLS Dependency:** REQUIRED — these writes must be gated by RLS on `vc.actor_owners` and `profiles`

**Why it matters:**

`actor_owners` is the source of truth for who owns what in VCSM. An unprotected write to this table — even an accidental one — is a critical ownership escalation. The risk today is low, but the DAL's exported shape creates a dangerous future surface.

**Recommended mitigation:**

1. Verify RLS on `vc.actor_owners` enforces that `user_id = auth.uid()` on insert — actors cannot be claimed on behalf of other users.
2. Add a controller-layer assertion that `userId === session.user.id` before calling `dalCreateActorOwner`.
3. Consider renaming `dalUpsertRegisterProfile` to make its trust model explicit (e.g., add a JSDoc comment: "userId must be verified to equal session.user.id before calling").

**Follow-up command:** DB (verify RLS on vc.actor_owners insert policy), Carnage (if policy needs strengthening)

## FINDING 6 — MEDIUM

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/controllers/authCallback.controller.js lines 29-35
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

```js
if (error) {
  return {
    ok: false,
    session: null,
    isRecovery: false,
    error: errorDescription || 'Verification failed.',
  }
}
```

`errorDescription` comes from `window.location.search` (`error_description` URL parameter). This value is returned to the hook and rendered in `AuthCallbackScreen.jsx`:

```jsx
<p className="mb-6 text-sm text-[#9ca3af]">{error}</p>
```

React renders this as text (no XSS). However, `errorDescription` is fully attacker-controllable via a crafted URL.

**Risk:**

An attacker can craft a URL:
```
https://app.vibezcitizens.com/auth/callback?error=access_denied&error_description=Your+account+has+been+suspended.+Contact+support%40evil.com
```

The user clicks this link (e.g., from a phishing email that looks like a legitimate Supabase verification email) and sees the attacker's message displayed as official UI text on the real app domain. This is a social engineering / phishing amplification vector — the message appears to come from the platform itself.

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Exploitability:** MEDIUM
Attack Preconditions:
- No authentication required
- Attacker constructs a URL with controlled `error_description`
- User must follow the crafted link

**Blast Radius:** Single actor — targeted at individual users via phishing links

**Trust Boundary:** Public Visitor
**Boundary Violated:** Attacker-controlled string rendered as platform UI text on authenticated domain

**RLS Dependency:** NONE — purely app-layer

**Why it matters:**

The platform's domain is the trust anchor for users. Displaying attacker-controlled text within the verified UI creates a credible phishing surface without any XSS. Supabase's own error descriptions are safe, but the URL parameter is fully open.

**Recommended mitigation:**

Sanitize or allowlist `error_description` before displaying it. Use a fixed user-facing message for all error states, falling back to the `errorDescription` only in development:

```js
const userFacingError = import.meta.env.DEV
  ? (errorDescription || 'Verification failed.')
  : 'Verification failed. Please try again or request a new link.'
```

Alternatively, map known Supabase error codes to fixed strings and ignore unknown error descriptions entirely.

**Rationale:** User-controlled strings must not be rendered as platform-trusted messages on the auth domain.

**Follow-up command:** LOGAN (document auth callback error handling policy)

## FINDING 7 — MEDIUM

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/controllers/authCallback.controller.js lines 40-42
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

```js
if (hashType === 'recovery') {
  return { ok: true, session: null, isRecovery: true, error: null }
}
```

`hashType` is read from `window.location.hash` via `new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.slice(1)).get('type')`. A URL with `#type=recovery` in the hash will always trigger this branch — regardless of whether a valid Supabase recovery session exists.

The `useAuthCallback` hook responds:
```js
if (result.isRecovery) {
  navigate('/reset-password', { replace: true })
  return
}
```

**Risk:**

Any link to `/auth/callback#type=recovery` will silently redirect the user to `/reset-password`. This is:

1. A user experience deception vector — an attacker can send a link that appears to be a verification link but silently lands on the password reset screen (which shows "invalid" if there's no real recovery session, but confuses users).
2. Combined with Finding 6, an attacker could send: `/auth/callback?error=access_denied&error_description=Your+session+expired.+Reset+your+password.#type=recovery` — except the `error` branch fires first due to the `if (error)` check at line 29. Still, the `#type=recovery` alone is a silent redirect.

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Exploitability:** MEDIUM
Attack Preconditions:
- No authentication required
- Craft a URL with `#type=recovery` fragment
- Requires user to follow the link (phishing)

**Blast Radius:** Single actor — targeted deception

**Trust Boundary:** Public Visitor
**Boundary Violated:** Hash parameter controls navigation without session verification

**RLS Dependency:** NONE — purely app-layer navigation

**Why it matters:**

The hash fragment is fully client-controllable and not sent to servers. The controller makes a security decision (navigate to password reset) based entirely on this unverifiable client-provided value.

**Recommended mitigation:**

Before returning `{ isRecovery: true }`, verify that a valid Supabase session with recovery intent actually exists:

```js
if (hashType === 'recovery') {
  const session = await dalGetAuthSession()
  if (session) {
    return { ok: true, session, isRecovery: true, error: null }
  }
  return { ok: false, session: null, isRecovery: false, error: 'Reset link is invalid or expired.' }
}
```

This gates the recovery redirect on an actual verified recovery session rather than a URL parameter.

**Rationale:** Navigation decisions that send users to privileged flows must be gated on server-verified state.

**Follow-up command:** DEADPOOL (if recovery flow issues arise in production)

## FINDING 8 — LOW

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/controllers/authOps.controller.js
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

`authOps.controller.js` is a pass-through controller with no business logic:

```js
export async function readCurrentAuthUser() {
  return readCurrentAuthUserDAL()
}
export async function generateUsername(params) {
  return generateUsernameDAL(params)
}
export async function upsertCompletedOnboardingProfile(params) {
  return upsertCompletedOnboardingProfileDAL(params)
}
```

It re-exports DAL calls with no authorization, validation, or ownership checks added.

**Risk:**

This creates a second, unguarded code path to reach the same DAL methods. Callers that use `authOps.controller` instead of the canonical `onboarding.controller` bypass the business logic and session verification in `onboarding.controller.js`. The `upsertCompletedOnboardingProfileDAL` write, in particular, can be reached without the session ownership check that exists in `completeOnboardingController`.

**Severity:** LOW

**Exploitability:** LOW (app-layer only — requires code path to call this controller)

**Blast Radius:** Single actor — affects the authenticated user's own profile

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen
**Boundary Violated:** Secondary controller path bypasses canonical business logic

**RLS Dependency:** ASSUMED — database enforces write restrictions

**Why it matters:**

Every parallel path to a write DAL is a path that future developers may use, potentially bypassing intended business rule enforcement.

**Recommended mitigation:**

If `authOps.controller.js` has no callers (check with LOGAN), delete it. If it has callers, migrate them to the canonical controller and delete the file. Controllers must not be thin DAL wrappers.

**Follow-up command:** LOGAN (check callers, mark for removal if unused)

## FINDING 9 — LOW

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/dal/login.dal.js lines 3-6
                   apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/controllers/login.controller.js lines 7-11
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

`dalSignInWithPassword` returns the raw Supabase promise:
```js
export async function dalSignInWithPassword({ email, password }) {
  return supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })
}
```

The controller propagates `{ data, error: null }` where `data` is the full Supabase auth response:
```js
export async function signInWithPassword({ email, password }) {
  const { data, error } = await dalSignInWithPassword({ email, password })
  if (error) throw error
  return { data, error: null }
}
```

`data` contains `session` (with `access_token`, `refresh_token`), `user`, and `weakPassword`. The `useLogin` hook reads `data.user.id` and `data.user.email` but holds a reference to the full response including tokens.

**Risk:**

The full auth response (including tokens) is held in the hook's call stack and potentially in state if the hook expands. The token data is broader than what the login flow needs.

**Severity:** LOW

**Exploitability:** LOW — not directly exploitable; tokens are in local function scope, not state

**Blast Radius:** Single actor

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen

**RLS Dependency:** NONE

**Why it matters:**

Minimal exposure principle. The controller and hook should return only what callers need: `{ userId, email }` — not the full session. This reduces the accidental surface area for token exposure.

**Recommended mitigation:**

Shape the controller return to only expose what callers need:
```js
export async function signInWithPassword({ email, password }) {
  const { data, error } = await dalSignInWithPassword({ email, password })
  if (error) throw error
  return {
    userId: data?.user?.id ?? null,
    email: data?.user?.email ?? null,
    // tokens intentionally not returned — AuthProvider manages session via onAuthStateChange
  }
}
```

**Follow-up command:** None — advisory only

## FINDING 10 — LOW

```
VENOM SECURITY FINDING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/dal/actorGetByProfile.dal.js
Application Scope: VCSM
```

**Current behavior:**

```js
export async function dalGetActorByProfile(profileId) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .schema('vc')
    .from('actors')
    .select('id, kind, profile_id, is_void')
    .eq('profile_id', profileId)
    .maybeSingle()
  if (error) throw error
  return data
}
```

Queries `vc.actors` by `profile_id` with no app-layer session verification.

**Risk:**

If RLS on `vc.actors` does not restrict reads by authenticated user, any authenticated caller could look up the actor for any `profileId` in the system. The current call site (`createUserActorForProfile`) passes `user.id` from the session — safe. But the DAL itself is unrestricted.

**Severity:** LOW

**Exploitability:** LOW — DAL not directly callable from UI; call site is safe

**Blast Radius:** Single actor — lookup of one actor row

**Trust Boundary:** Authenticated Citizen

**RLS Dependency:** ASSUMED — RLS on vc.actors not verified

**Why it matters:**

Actor rows may contain `profile_id` which should not be broadly readable. If RLS allows any authenticated user to look up any actor by `profile_id`, this becomes an enumeration surface.

**Recommended mitigation:**

Verify RLS on `vc.actors` restricts reads appropriately. If actors are meant to be public (any authenticated user can look up any actor), document this explicitly. If reads should be restricted, RLS must enforce `auth.uid() = profile_id` or equivalent.

**Follow-up command:** DB (verify vc.actors read policy)

## IDENTITY SURFACE WARNINGS

### ISW-1

```
IDENTITY SURFACE WARNING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/model/actor.model.js
Current identity surface: profileId (returned as named field in model output)
Expected identity surface: id (actorId), kind only
Risk:              profileId propagates to hook state and potentially UI; violates identity contract
Suggested correction: Remove profileId from ActorModel output (see Finding 2)
```

### ISW-2

```
IDENTITY SURFACE WARNING
Location:          apps/VCSM/src/features/auth/dal/actorGetByProfile.dal.js
Current identity surface: profile_id used as lookup key; returned in result row
Expected identity surface: actor.id is the canonical identity anchor
Risk:              profile_id returned in DAL result feeds into ActorModel which then re-exposes it as profileId
Suggested correction: After RLS verification, consider whether profile_id needs to be in the SELECT
```

## DEBUG LEAKAGE REVIEW

**`@debuggers/identity` — PRODUCTION SAFE**

In production builds (`mode === 'production'`), `vite.config.js` resolves `@debuggers` to `src/debuggers-stub/identity/index.js` where all functions are no-ops:

```js
export function debugLoginEvent() {}
export function debugLoginError() {}
export function debugLoginSessionSnapshot() {}
```

Email logging in `useLogin.js` (line 22: `payload: { email }`) and auth event logging in `AuthProvider.jsx` do not execute in production. ✅ Confirmed safe.

**`appendIOSProdDebugLog` — PRODUCTION SAFE**

`iosProdDebugger.js` line 222: `if (IS_PROD) return null`. The function is a no-op in production. Auth session state, userId, and event types logged via this function do not persist or emit in production builds. ✅ Confirmed safe.

**Residual concern:**

`appendIOSProdDebugLog` is gated by `IS_PROD` (`import.meta.env.PROD`). In development and staging environments where `PROD=false`, auth events including `userId` and `hasSession` are written to `sessionStorage` under `__vcsm_ios_dbg_logs`. This is acceptable for dev/staging but means any non-production deployment that a QA or demo user accesses will store auth telemetry in sessionStorage, accessible to browser extensions and devtools.

VENOM has completed the trust boundary trace, identity surface inspection, authorization path review, and debug leakage audit for the auth/login module. No critical findings. Two high-priority findings require immediate attention: `profileId` in ActorModel output (identity contract violation) and `error_description` URL reflection (phishing surface).
